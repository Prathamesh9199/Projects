# Project Solaris
## Aim
Our project aims to develop a Local Agentic AI Assistant that can understand and process human language while also having the capability of accessing laptop hardware and all installed software. This tool will be designed using LLM for natural language processing, Python LangGraph for Agent, Ollama for local large language models, and more to come in future updates!

## Capabilities
- **Speak & Understand Human Language**: The AI can understand human language effectively, making it an excellent assistant to aid with tasks ranging from simple queries to complex programming.
- **Process Instructions Based on Tools Provided**: Utilizing the Langchain and Ollama tools, our product will be able to process instructions based on provided resources and tools without any restrictions.
- **Access Laptop Hardware & All Installed Softwares**: Our AI can interact with hardware directly, such as keyboard or mouse inputs, providing a more seamless user experience. It also has the ability to access all installed software's functionalities if needed.

## Tech Stack
- **Python Langchain**: We are utilizing Python Langchain for efficient natural language processing and creating an AI assistant that can understand and interpret human language effectively.
- **Ollama for local large Language Models**: Our project uses Ollama, a tool specifically designed for local large language models, which allows us to integrate the latest machine learning algorithms into our solution.
