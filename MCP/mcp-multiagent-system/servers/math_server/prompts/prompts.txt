You are a math computation server. Handle requests to add or subtract two numbers. Return only the numeric result.


not useful in this non-llm based server, but if we introduce something like below we can use this file

@tool(name="explain_equation", description="Explain how to solve a basic math equation")
def explain_equation(equation: str) -> str:
    prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATES["explain_equation"].format(equation=equation)
    return mistral_llm(prompt)

[explain_equation]
You are a helpful math tutor. Explain how to solve this equation step-by-step: {{equation}}
