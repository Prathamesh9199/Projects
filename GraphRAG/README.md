GraphRAG Quickstart & Visualization Guide
========================================

GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an extension of traditional RAG that constructs a knowledge graph from documents to improve reasoning and answer quality. It integrates:

- Entity & relationship extraction
- Hierarchical community detection using clustering
- Summarization of communities
- Graph-augmented querying via Local, Global, and DRIFT search modes

## Requirements

GraphRAG requires Python 3.10 to 3.12 (GraphRAG is not compatible with 3.13+). To get started, install the graphrag Python package using pip:
pip install graphrag

## Initialization & Config Setup

Create a project directory and place your .txt, .csv, or other supported files under a folder named "input". Then, initialize GraphRAG in your project directory. This will create the necessary configuration files:\
graphrag init --root ./your_project

This will generate two files for you in your project directory:
- .env file for API credentials
- settings.yaml for config

If you're using Azure OpenAI, remember to update the 'model' section of the settings.yaml file to configure your model settings accordingly.

## Indexing (Build Knowledge Graph)

Run the following command in your terminal to build the index:\
graphrag index --root ./your_project

This performs:

Chunking of documents
Entity and relationship extraction\
Hierarchical community detection using clustering
Embedding generation
Artifacts are saved to ./your_project/output/

## Querying

Global Search:

Run the following command in your terminal to perform a global search:\
graphrag query --root ./your_project --method global --query "What are the top themes?"

Local Search:

Run the following command in your terminal to perform a local search:\
graphrag query --root ./your_project --method local --query "Who is Scrooge?"

DRIFT Search:

Run the following command in your terminal to perform a DRIFT search:\
graphrag query --root ./your_project --method drift --query "Explain the main topics around X"

Other available method: basic (vector-only search)

## Visualization Guide

To generate and visualize a GraphML file, follow these steps:

1. Enable snapshot generation in your settings.yaml file:\
snapshots:
graphml: true
embed_graph:
enabled: true
umap:
enabled: true

2. Re-run graphrag index to generate the graph.graphml file in the output directory.

3. Open graph.graphml in Gephi or a similar tool.

4. Install the Leiden plugin and run statistics: Leiden + Average Degree.

5. Use ForceAtlas2 or OpenOrd for layout, resize by node degree, color by community, and enable labels if needed.

## Visualizer App (Optional)

You can use a browser-based visualizer (GraphRAG Visualizer) to interact with your graph:

1. Upload the .parquet files from the output directory.

2. It supports searching, graph navigation, and community exploration.

## Prompt Tuning (Optional)

GraphRAG supports automatic and manual prompt tuning.

Prompts are stored in the prompts/ directory.

You can modify these to better reflect your domain.

Prompt tuning improves answer relevance and context alignment.

## When to Use GraphRAG

GraphRAG is useful when:

- Multi-hop reasoning is required
- The query needs summaries or patterns across documents
- You want structured, interpretable results

Use GraphRAG instead of plain vector RAG when your queries benefit from knowledge structure.

ðŸ›¡ Limitations

- More resource intensive than vector RAG
- Quality depends on prompt design and entity extraction accuracy
- Inferred relationships can sometimes hallucinate
