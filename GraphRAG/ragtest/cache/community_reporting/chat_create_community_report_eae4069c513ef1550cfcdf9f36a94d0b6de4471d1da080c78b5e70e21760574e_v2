He is a wealthy businessman who is indifferent to the plight of the poor and destitute, preferring to focus on his own affairs. Scrooge is the employer of Bob Cratchit and is the subject of disdain among the Cratchit family due to his stingy and unfeeling nature. He lives alone in a gloomy suite of rooms and works in a counting-house, maintaining a solitary existence that is marked by his cynicism about Christmas and his dislike of merriment.\n\nScrooge was a business partner of Marley, and he is the surviving partner who is known for his tight-fisted and covetous ways. Despite his wealth, Scrooge is comical in his ill whims and is particularly known for his dislike of his nephew and niece. His solitary lifestyle is characterized by a preference for keeping his distance from others, showing little human sympathy or warmth.\n\nHowever, Scrooge's life takes a dramatic turn when he begins experiencing visions of his past, present, and future.

These supernatural events lead him to reflect deeply on his past experiences and the choices he made regarding wealth and relationships. Scrooge observes the Cratchit family and becomes concerned about Tiny Tim's future, which prompts him to reconsider his actions and attitudes.\n\nThroughout these visions, Scrooge is shown scenes that evoke a range of emotions, from horror to reflection, as he witnesses the events and conversations around him. He interacts with the Spirit and the Phantom, learning valuable lessons that challenge his cynical views and miserly ways. Scrooge's journey through these supernatural experiences is marked by a transformation, as he begins to understand the significance of human connection and generosity.\n\nUltimately, Scrooge undergoes a profound change, becoming generous and kind-hearted, especially towards Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim.
