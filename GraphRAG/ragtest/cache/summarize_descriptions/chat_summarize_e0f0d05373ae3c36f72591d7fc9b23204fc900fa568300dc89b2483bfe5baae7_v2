Marley, who has since passed away, now appears to Scrooge as a ghost. His spectral visits are not merely for companionship; they serve a crucial purpose.

As a ghost, Marley embodies the consequences of a life spent in pursuit of wealth at the expense of personal relationships and moral integrity. His appearances are a pivotal moment for Scrooge, prompting him to reflect on his own life choices and the potential repercussions of his actions.
