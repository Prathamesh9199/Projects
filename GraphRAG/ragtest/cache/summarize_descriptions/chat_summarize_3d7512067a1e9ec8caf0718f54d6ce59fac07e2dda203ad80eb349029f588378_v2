Their partnership was well-established, and the name of their firm reflected their close professional association. Marley, however, has been deceased for seven years, leaving Scrooge to continue the business alone. Despite Marley's death, his presence lingers in Scrooge's life in a haunting manner. Scrooge is frequently reminded of Marley, as his face appears in Scrooge's thoughts, serving as a spectral reminder of their past partnership and the life they once shared.\n\nOne particularly eerie manifestation of Marley's lingering presence is his face appearing on the door knocker of Scrooge's residence. This unsettling image serves as a constant reminder to Scrooge of his former partner, reinforcing the spectral connection between the two. The haunting memory of Marley is a significant aspect of Scrooge's life, influencing his thoughts and actions even years after Marley's passing.\n\nThe relationship between Scrooge and Marley was not only professional but also deeply impactful on Scrooge's personal life. Marley's death has left a void that is filled with memories and spectral reminders, which continue to affect Scrooge's demeanor and outlook on life. The haunting presence of Marley serves as a catalyst for Scrooge's introspection and eventual transformation, as he grapples with the legacy of their partnership and the consequences of his own actions.\n\nIn summary, Ebenezer Scrooge and Jacob Marley were once inseparable business partners, operating under the firm name Scrooge and Marley.
