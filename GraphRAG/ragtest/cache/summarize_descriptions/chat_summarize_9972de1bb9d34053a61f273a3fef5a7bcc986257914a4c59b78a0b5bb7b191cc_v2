Marley, who has been deceased for seven years, played a significant role in Scrooge's life, both professionally and personally.

This connection is further emphasized by the haunting presence of Marley in Scrooge's life, even after his death. Scrooge is frequently haunted by the memory of Marley, whose face appears in his thoughts, serving as a constant reminder of their shared history and the impact Marley had on him.\n\nOne of the most striking manifestations of Marley's lingering presence is the appearance of his face on the door knocker of Scrooge's residence. This eerie occurrence symbolizes the enduring influence Marley has over Scrooge, despite his physical absence. The door knocker serves as a tangible representation of Marley's continued presence in Scrooge's life, acting as a bridge between the past and the present.\n\nThe relationship between Scrooge and Marley was not only defined by their business dealings but also by the profound effect Marley had on Scrooge's psyche. Marley's death left a void in Scrooge's life, yet his memory continues to shape Scrooge's actions and thoughts. This haunting presence suggests that Marley was more than just a business partner; he was a significant figure in Scrooge's life, whose influence persists beyond the grave.\n\nIn summary, Ebenezer Scrooge and Jacob Marley were business partners whose firm, Scrooge and Marley, was a testament to their collaboration.
