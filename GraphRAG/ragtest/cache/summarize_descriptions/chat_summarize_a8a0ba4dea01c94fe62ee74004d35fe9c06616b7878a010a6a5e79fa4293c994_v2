Despite his death, Marley's presence continues to haunt Scrooge, both literally and figuratively.

This haunting serves as a reminder of their past partnership and the life choices they made. Even in death, Marley's influence lingers, with his name still prominently displayed on the business sign, signifying the lasting impact of their professional relationship.
